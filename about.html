			<h2>My Story</h2>
	        <p>Born and brought up all around North India, Chandigarh has been my hometown since 11 years now. I passed out class 10 from St.Anne's Convent School, Chandigarh. Sports were always something that kindled a new fire to perform and enjoy. I played Softball at the state at UT level for 4 years. Sketching, doodling was my favourite way to pass the boring lectures. No, it wasn't all boring at sschool, I got a chance to explore the world of designing, coding and web development. It was during this time that I made a live-project And then, like most other Indians, JEE happened. No TV, no sports(though I did try to get involved in them for some time), just JEE. But, as they say, nothing is too bad to not have it's good moments. I explored the amazing world of Mathematics, credits to my institute professor. I scored a 100 at a test, something that happened after 15 years. It didn't stop there, I went on to learn a lot of new stuff, the applications of mathematics in origami and design perscpectives, the use of calculus and game theory and much more. JEE didn't really go how I wanted it to, but I got into my dream institute in a field of my interest. I joined the computational Linguistics programme in IIIT Hyderabad (not IIT, mind the 3rd I). I made a lot of friends and also became a member of the Students Parliament here, carrying on streak of making it to the house since school. And the journey continues, hoping to reach the skies.....</p>

	            <h2>Interests</h2>
	            <p>Have you ever tried counting the number of stars in the sky. Don't worry, neither have I. What I have done is trying to search for all possible shades of different colors, my last count being 632. I won't call myself an artist, doodler sounds cooler. Most of my comic characters and other stuff is done on the margins of my notebooks, either during class or anytime after.</p>
	            <p>I really enjoy working on graphics and designing which is the reason I made most of the official movies at school. Puzzle solving has been my thing always, I still cant forget the number of hours I have wasted in solving problems even when I had a test the next day. I am a die hard cricket fan, not having missed a single match since the 2007 world cup. I really love playing cricket, softball and baseball. Yes folks, baseball, it's not an easy sport. Mathematics and MAT problems is something I enjoy a lot, Cheryl's Birthday, the 25 horses problem etc. are some of my favourites. I really love wathching movie, Shawshank Redemption, The Pursuit of Happiness and The Green Mile among my Top 3</p>
	            <p>Working with teams and leading them is my thing and I good at that. I made it to the school parliament twice, and again went on to be a Member of Parliament at IIIT. I feel I connect well with people and everyone finds me really approachable. There's still a lot of things to achieve, a lot of passions to fulfil. But no matter which field i work in, I just want to enjoy working with my team and bringing out more than what I actually think of myself.</p>

	        	<h2>Achievements</h2>
	            <p>Achievements, well, this is one section which is the most difficult to write about. I am not Steve Jobs or Farhan Akhtar that I can go on filling up my works, and my 'notified achievemts'. I wont give a lot of trouble to my fingers, typing out my JEE ranks and stuff. I did miss out at NTSE by 1 mark, believe me, Chandigarh has a high marks/number of selections ratio. I made it to the School Cabinet twice, as the youngest member of Parliament and the one in the parliament maximum number of times if you count that as an achievement.</p>
	            <p>You must admit, making it to the techiest college in India is an achievement in itself. I didnt have a vast coding background like many others here, but I did work on a project for BBMB Chandigarh in school. Suprsingly, I somehow made it to the Students Parliament. And we made a fair amount of progress working for the betterment of the institute but there's still a long way to go.
